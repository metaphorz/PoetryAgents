# Test Instructions - Model Dropdown Fix

## üß™ How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Open the Interface
```bash
# Open in browser
open poetry_generator_live.html
# OR double-click the file
```

### Step 2: Check Debug Panel
- **Look for the debug panel** at the top of the page
- Should show: "Debug Output: Interface loading..."
- Watch for messages like:
  - "Model data loaded: YES"
  - "Direct API providers: Claude, Gemini, OpenAI"
  - "Claude: 6 models" (or similar counts)

### Step 3: Test Provider Selection
1. **Select "Claude"** for Poet 1
   - Debug panel should show: "Poet 1 provider changed to: Claude"
   - Model dropdown should **immediately populate** with options like:
     - Claude Sonnet 4
     - Claude Opus 4.1
     - Claude Haiku 3.5
     - etc.

2. **Select "OpenAI"** for Poet 2
   - Debug panel shows: "Poet 2 provider changed to: OpenAI" 
   - Model dropdown populates with:
     - GPT-4o
     - GPT-4o Mini
     - etc.

### Step 4: Test OpenRouter Mode
1. **Click "OpenRouter" radio button**
   - Direct API dropdowns should disappear
   - OpenRouter provider dropdowns appear
   
2. **Select "Anthropic"** for Poet 1
   - Model dropdown should populate with OpenRouter models
   - Debug shows: "Found X OpenRouter models for anthropic"

### Step 5: Generate Poetry
1. **Fill all required fields:**
   - Theme: "moonlit garden path"
   - Form: Haiku
   - Rounds: 2
   - Emojis: No

2. **Click "Generate Poetry Script"**
   - Should show download section
   - Debug shows: "Python script generated successfully"

### JavaScript Errors

- Look for red error messages
- Common issues: element not found, function undefined

### Debug Panel Not Showing

## üìû Getting Help

If the fix doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Look at debug panel messages
