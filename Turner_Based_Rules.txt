Adhere to Poetic Form* Respect the structural rules of specific forms like sestinas, sonnets, or villanelles.* Example: A sestina must have six six-line stanzas followed by a three-line envoi, adhering to a strict pattern of word repetition.2. Maintain Natural Scansion* Ensure lines flow smoothly and adhere to the intended meter.* Avoid awkward phrasing that disrupts rhythm, such as overly long or fragmented sentences.3. Avoid Forced Inversions* Refrain from inverting natural word order just to meet rhyming or metrical constraints.* Example: Rewrite “Could we, by will alone, this love reclaim?” to avoid unnatural syntax.4. Use Idiomatic and Accessible Language* Employ natural, conversational phrasing unless the poem calls for heightened diction.* Example: Replace “We fought to clear the choking weight from air” with more idiomatic alternatives.5. Refine Imagery* Opt for vivid, sensory descriptions that evoke emotions and scenes effectively.* Replace generic expressions with specific, tangible imagery to create a stronger impact.6. Balance Emotional Tones* Combine contrasting emotions (e.g., love and doubt) to add depth and complexity to the poem.* Avoid oversimplification of themes or one-dimensional emotional expressions.7. Pay Special Attention to Endings* Ensure the conclusion (especially in structured forms) resonates emotionally and adheres to form rules.* Example: A sestina's envoi should succinctly capture the theme while employing the required terminal words.8. Revise Based on Feedback* Actively address critiques, such as:o Improving scansion and rhythm.o Simplifying overly complex metaphors.o Adjusting structure to meet formal requirements.9. Focus on Thematic Coherence* Keep the poem’s central theme clear throughout the piece, even in complex forms like sestinas.10. Iterate to Perfection* Poetry is a collaborative and iterative process. Revisit and refine drafts to align with formal constraints, thematic intent, and emotional resonance.
