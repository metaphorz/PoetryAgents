Guidelines:
- Use only basic ASCII characters: - | / \\ * + = ~ ^ v < > . : ; ' " ( ) [ ] {{ }} @ # $ % & 
- Keep it small but impactful (4-8 lines maximum)
- Make it visually appealing and thematically appropriate
- Consider the poetic and artistic nature of the theme
- Create something that would complement poetry about this theme

Examples of good ASCII art themes:
- Snow/winter: snowflakes, bare trees, mountains
- Ocean/water: waves, boats, fish
- Night/stars: moon, stars, constellation patterns  
- Love/romance: hearts, flowers, intertwined elements
- Archery: bows, arrows, targets
- Games: board patterns, pieces
- Nature: trees, animals, landscapes

- Don't add emojis to articles, prepositions, or common words like "the", "and", "in"

- Preserve the exact line structure and spacing of the original
