# Poetry Agent Dialogue

## Software Requirements

Use Git version control by init when the project is created
Create a .gitignore file and when pushing to GitHub, do not push the .gitignore file 
Period requests to commit will be given by the user, so do not do this automatically
Always work in the main branch unless requested to make a new branch, with later merge

When requested to refactor or test by the user, proceed with minimal user interaction
Keep all tests and test results in a /tests directory
After each refactor and tests, commit to Git

## Overview

This project simulates a system where two AI agents can communicate by exchanging text. Thus, the system is a generator of a dialogue. Agent's have randomly selected names from fictional characters of famous novels. Just use first names. 

## Software Architecture

The LLM called Sonnet 4 will be used by Anthropic. All poetry will be generated by this LLM as if the LLM were being used by a human. 

In addition, if the LLM needs other software to perform its task, bring this to the attention of the user. For example, some parsing software may count syllables or search for semantically related words.

Write only as much software (code) as necessary, while maximally leveraging the LLM to obtain each component of the dialogue.

Do not use any simulated code or mock/substitute code. Just perform as these instructions.

## User Interface

### Questions

The interface asks the user specific questions before generating the dialogue:

1. what is the theme?
2. How many agents are there?
3. What is the form of dialogue?
4. What is the length of each poem?
5. What is the length of the conversation?

### Question Descriptions

1. Theme: the user provides a set of words or a phrase or sentence. As an example, the user says "A walk in the snow"
2. Agents: the user provides a number of agents. As an example, the user says "2"
3. Form: the user provides a form of dialogue. You should just do haiku or prose for now. Haiku is a rigid format of 5-7-5 syllables. Prose is free verse.
4. Poem Length: the user provides a length of dialogue in lines. As an example, the user says "6"  meaning a haiku of 2 parts (3 lines per part). For prose, the user says "6" meaning 6 lines of prose for each speaker.
5. Conversation Length: the user provides a length of dialogue in poems.  As an example, the user says "2" meaning that each agent will have 2 poems, comprising 4 poems total.
 
## Poetic Form

Each poetic form has rules. These rules embed the concepts of meter and rhyme. Abide by the rules of the poetic form.

Do not put in additional text such as "Here is a poem" or "I'll craft a Haiku". Just put in the poetry headed by the agent's name

Always put a blank space after each verse

## Dialogue Format

The first agent to create its poetry will base this poetry on the user's theme. Each subsequent agent will base its poetry on the poetry of the previous agent. A dialogue operates in this fashion. Basing poetry on the previous agent can be done by reusing a phrase or word, or words previously spoken.

## Example

1. what is the theme? a walk in the snow
2. How many agents are there?
3. What is the form of dialogue?
4. What is the length of each poem?
5. What is the length of the conversation? 1

This generates the following output, starting with a title.

Winter Walk (in larger bold font)
[this title is made from the user's theme]

Alpha: (in bold)
[Here is what I entered: make a haiku that is of 2 stanzas about a walk in the snow]
[this is in a format of make a <form entered by user> about a <theme entered by user>]
[this will end up coded as a request based on a prompt to the LLM]

Fresh snow crunches soft
Beneath my careful footsteps—
Silent world awaits

Breath clouds drift and fade
While bare branches frame the sky
Peace in winter's grip

Beta:
[I entered: Now imagine this haiku was spoken by an agent called Alpha. Beta now responds to Alpha. This response is based in some way on what Alpha has said. Go ahead]

Your tracks mark the path
I follow through drifted white—
Two souls, one winter

Where you found silence
I hear whispers in the wind
Speaking of spring's hope

[If not limited by the user's length of conversation, this process would continue]
[your code is simply a scaffold around prompts to the LLM]
